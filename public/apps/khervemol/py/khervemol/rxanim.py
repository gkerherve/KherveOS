"""Reaction animation (Qt-free): reactant atoms travel to product atoms.

A balanced equation says *what* is conserved, not *which* atom ends up
where. `map_atoms` chooses a bijection between the reactant and product
atoms of the same element that keeps as many bonds as possible (a C–H
that survives, an O=O that stays together), then prefers atoms that keep
company (neighbours landing in the same product molecule) and, last,
atoms that have to travel the least.

`Animation` turns that mapping into a film with four keyframes per atom:

* **A** — the reactant molecules spread out on the left,
* **B** — the same molecules packed into a "collision" cluster,
* **C** — the product molecules packed in the same place, each atom at its
  mapped product position,
* **D** — the product molecules spread out on the right.

Progress 0..1 runs A → B (approach), B → C (the reactant bonds break, the
atoms swing to their product places, the new bonds form), C → D (separate). The
atoms and bond list are the reactant scene's own, so a viewer only has to
call `Animation.apply(mol, p)` and redraw.
